# FTX Data Analysis Project

## Learnings

00. SVGs have view ports and view boxes. View ports are the tv screen. view boxes determine the content on the screen by defining the top left corner and dimensions
01. You can create really flexible, reusible, chainable funcitons through closures
02. The comma operator lets you evaluate an expression on the left and return whatever is on the right, eg (2, 3) => // 3, (let x = 0, ++x) => //1
03. Promises in console? That's an async function. You can write a main function and define it as async, invoke it after definition, and set anything that's async to await
04. To create responsive charts, you MUST use viewbox


## TODO

"Maximize impact per time. What looks like more to people?"


00. Types of charts
02. Appropriately sized charts
01. Chart complexity


Goal: make SVG charts truly responsive:
- [â†’]
- [ ]
- [ ]



Goal: add icon array functionality
- [ ]


Goal: add bar chart functionality
- [ ]


Goal: extend scatter plot funcitonality
- [ ] Add color for different data types to charts, use ordinal scale
- [ ] Vary radius size by a quantatative measure


### Done

01. Hero animation
02. Reusable scatter plot
03. Scatter plot is responsive to data (d3 scales)
