          Sam Bankman-Fried told investors FTX's assets lost significant value in a short period of time leading up to the bankruptcy, leading to liquidity issues when there 'was a run on the bank.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional bank accounts, most FTX deposits were explicitly not to be lent out, making most of their deposits akin to safety deposit boxes. FTX charged fees on a per-transaction basis to use these funds, just as a bank would charge a monthly fee to have a safety deposit box.
        </p>
        <p>
          If FTX, which had more than a hundred associated legal entities, made the promised distinction between funds in digital safety deposit boxes ('wallets') and the funds in their lending program, which they promised to do in their terms of service, it would be impossible for customers with funds in their digital wallets to be affected by either liquidity or insolvency issues that stemmed from the lending program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike checking and savings accounts held in banks, all FTX deposits were not insured. So, any funds unable to be recovered through bankruptcy are gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          This situates the disaster at FTX as possibly one of the largest single instances of fraud ever, and certainly the largest in the context of crypotcurrency.

          A cursory examination of their portfolio before and after the outbreak of the crisis reveals a significant collapse in the claimed value of their portfolio from 'less liquid' assets, i.e. cryptocurriencies. Their largest holding, a cryptocurrency that they had created and sold to customers which entitled customers to discounts when they used FTX for transactions, was worth more than 30% of their total portfolio before the outbreak of the disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
          For lack of a better comparison, imagine if Bed Bath and Beyond printed and issued 20% off coupons to customers, but retained the majority of them and listed them as assets on their balance sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the most valueable portions of FTX's portfolio are two equity positions in Twitter and Robinhood. While they hold a significant number of different cryptocurrencies, bankruptcy proceedings can last years and selling the assets could permanently crash their value, which is mostly speculative.

          This makes it one of the instances of fraud ever, and one of the single worst investment losses ever.

          In the context of the financial system, this is still large, but on its own is a small peice of the overall pie.

          But, this is still extraordinarily large. Each dot below represents $1,000,000, roughly the additional lifetime earnings that come from completing an undergraduate degree.

          But, this is just one form of theft that effects everyday americans...

          In the United States $50 billion is stolen from hard-working Americans every year in the form of wage theft, primarily affecting those who earn minimum wage.
